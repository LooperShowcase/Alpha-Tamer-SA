    <h1>Body:</h1>
<hr>
<p><b>The body of the E60 was made using aluminium for the front of the car, and steel for the passenger cabin and rear. Kerb weights are 1,445–1,725 kg (3,186–3,803 lb) for the sedan and 1,675–1,830 kg (3,693–4,034 lb) for the wagon. The weight distribution of the sedan models was 50:50.
    An emergency hotline feature (BMW Assist) was also available for the E60. The BMW Assist system could also use the phone network to notify the driver and their preferred BMW dealership when servicing was due. This feature was standard on all E60 models sold in the United States.

<p><b>The official 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration figure is 4.7 seconds for the sedan, however magazine tests have recorded figures down to 4.1 seconds. The E60 M5 was the fastest 4-door sedan available at the time of its introduction; top speed is electronically restricted to 250 km/h (155 mph) but could be raised to 305 km/h (190 mph) with the optional M-driver's package. Unrestricted top speed of 205 mph. The M5 has recorded a Nürburgring lap time of 8:13.[53][54]

  Upgrades over regular 5 Series models include a wider track, unique body panels, a colourful heads up display featuring navigation, control messages, speed, rpm and gear selection information, automated seat side bolsters, heated/ventilated seats and power rear curtain. The larger, flared front guards on either side also featured cooling vents, reminiscent of the 1970s BMW CSL. The wheels were of 19-inch diameter and the car has quad exhaust pipes at the rear.</b></p>
