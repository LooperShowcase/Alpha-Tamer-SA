    <p>
        <b>The BMW S85B50 is a naturally aspirated V10 petrol engine which replaced the BMW S62 V8 engine in the M5 model and was produced from 2005â€“2010. It was both BMW's first and only production V10 engine, and the first petrol V10 engine to be available in a production sedan (saloon).

            Introduced in the E60 M5, the S85 was inspired by BMW's previous Formula One involvement.[1] Unlike most other BMW M engines, the S85 is not related to a regular production BMW engine.[2]
            
            The BMW S65 V8 engine (used in the E92 M3) is based on the S85.</b>

<p><b>The development programme for the E60 began in 1997, concluding in 2002. The lead designer was Boyke Boyer.[6] The final design, developed by Davide Arcangeli[7] under BMW Design Director Chris Bangle,[8][9] was approved in 2000 and German design patents filed on 16 April 2002.[10]

    The sedan was launched on 5 July 2003 in Europe and in October 2003 in North America.[11][12][13] In late 2004, the Touring models were introduced.</b></p>
